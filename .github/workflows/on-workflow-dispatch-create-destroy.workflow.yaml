#
# This github workflow allows to create / destroy infrastructure resources by
# responding to an "workflow_dispatch" event.
#
# This events can be triggered by a bot, pipelines hooks, platform integrations or even through
# github actions UI.
#
# If the event was triggered using the input "action" with the value "create", the workflow will
# create infrastructure resources managed by terraform. Here are use cases:
#   - A slack bot invokes this workflow after a schedule deletion of development environment.
#   - A code pipeline invokes this workflow to ensure that the infrastructure is in place
#        before triggering a code deployment (it can useful specially in disaster recoveries)
#   - Ansible invokes this workflow to recreate the infrastructure that it already destroyed.
#
#
# If the event was triggered using the input "action" with the value "destroy", the workflow will
# destroy infrastructure resources managed by terraform. Here are use cases:
#   - A slack bot invokes this workflow after to destroy of development environment because the
#        environment broke during the development process.
#   - Ansible invokes this workflow to destroy the infrastructure before recreate it because
#        something was wrong with the desired environment.
